================================
Generic Contact Forms for Django
================================

This is an application which provides a generic, extensible contact form
functionality for use in `Django`_ projects. For installation instructions, see
the file ``INSTALL.rst`` in this directory, and for documentation see the files
in the ``docs/`` directory.

The latest versions of these documents can always be viewed on the `GitHub`_
project web site for this application, which is located at
http://github.com/rcoyner/django-contact/.

The upcoming 0.4 release will break backwards compatability with previous
versions of django-contact. This is because the project directories have been
re-named.
