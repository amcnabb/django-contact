Generic Contact Forms for Django
================================

This is an application which provides generic, extensible contact form
functionality for use in Django_ projects; for installation
instructions, see the file ``INSTALL.txt`` in this directory, and for
documentation see the files in the ``docs/`` directory.

The latest versions of these documents can always be viewed on the GitHub
project web site for this application, which is located at
http://github.com/rcoyner/django-contact/.

The upcoming 0.4 release will break backwards compatability with previous
versions of django-contact.
